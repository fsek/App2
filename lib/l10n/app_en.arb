Many of these spex are located in the AF-borgen, while smaller nation spex often use the nation's own premises.\n\nBeing involved in a spex means you can take part in many different activities, such as building sets, making costumes, applying make-up, playing instruments or singing. Only a small part of the spex ensemble is on stage, which means there is plenty to do even for those who don't want to be in the spotlight. Rehearsals usually last 3-5 weeks during the semester, and depending on the size of the spex, a number of performances are then put on for both Lund students and the public.\n\nThe four largest spexes in Lund, all of which hold their performances in the main hall of the AF-borgen, are Jesper, Toddy, Boel and Lundaspexarna. Jesper is the technologist spex and is mainly aimed at technologist students, Toddy is mainly for medical students, Boel has only women on stage, and Lundaspexarna has only men on stage.",

Teknologkåren is divided into eleven guilds, where each guild represents one or several educational programmes. Every guild is run like a non profit organization by students from the guild’s programmes. You belong to the F-guild that consists of the programmes engineering physics, engineering mathematics and engineering nanotechnology. It is your guild that arranges your introduction. It is also your guild that takes care of all matters that concern your education, as well as contact with the business world, fun activities and anything else that you do during your time at the F-guild. During the introduction it is easy to recognize other guilds on their overalls since the overall is the color of the wearer's guild. The guilds are traditionally presented in the following order (which is the same as the order in which the guilds were created): F E M V A K D DOKT Ing W I.",
